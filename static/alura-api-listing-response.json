      "title": "Personalized poster as a gift Idea for man and woman for Valentine&#39;s Day, anniversary, wedding anniversary or wedding",
      "description": "This art print is the ideal gift for any occasion. Especially as a wedding gift, for anniversary, Valentine&#39;s Day, wedding anniversary or in between.\n\nOUR PAPER = OUR UNIQUE SELLING POINT\nThe printing takes place on high-quality paper produced in Germany by Hahnemühle. The white, 310g cardboard-like artist paper provides an enormous image depth with precise contrasts and has no plastic coating. This clearly distinguishes us from simple poster prints. You get a real art print here!\n\nTHAT&#39;S US\nWe are Anja, René and miniature dachshund Lotte. We manufacture everything ourselves and can guarantee the highest quality and first-class customer service with every order. With the purchase of our prints you get a satisfaction guarantee!\n\nSizes\nWe offer printing in sizes A6 to A1, 40 x 30 cm, 60 x 40 cm and 50 x 70 cm. You select the size during the ordering process.\n\nDIGITAL FILE\nYou will receive the product as a PDF file by e-mail to the e-mail address with which you ordered (please check SPAM folder!). You can print the file in all common DIN A sizes.\n\nFRAME/POSTER BAR\nBasically, there is no frame/poster bar in your print. With our high-quality A4 solid wood frames (black covered, white covered, natural oak), which are produced from sustainable, FSC-certified wood, you have the opportunity to buy the product as an all-in-one solution! The same applies to our high-quality poster strip made of solid oak wood. When ordering, select e.g. &quot;A4+ frame black&quot; or &quot;A4 + poster bar&quot;.\n\nPACKAGING EXPERIENCE\nYour order is a gift? Then you provide an additional WOW effect in addition to the already unmistakable unpacking experience with our great surprise, which is included with the order! We use sustainable cardboard, recycled packaging materials, stickers made of grass paper and wrapping paper made of natural rubber.\n\nDISPATCH\nShipping is fast and climate-neutral via DHL GoGreen and the German Post INCLUDING tracking number, which will be sent to you directly after shipping! As a registered user, you can track the shipment status at any time. This is not possible with a guest order.\n\nASK\nDo you have a question or a wish? Please do not hesitate to write to us! We will answer you as soon as possible.\n\nOUR SHOP\nFollow the link and discover our other products: www.naturbedacht.etsy.com",
